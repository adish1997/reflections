Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because git is made keeping programming in mind and programs may be inter related, dependency between files is less in case of google docs

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
