When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want other people to contribute to your project or keet it safe in case your system crashes.
    
 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
   
Because many people may commit changes and the changes might not always be for betterment
